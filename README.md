# Introduction
 
In the realm of cybersecurity, practical hands-on experience is crucial for understanding how to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Setting up a Metasploitable 2 machine in conjunction with Tenable Nessus provides an ideal environment for learning and honing these skills.

Metasploitable 2 is a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine designed for testing and development of security tools and techniques. By deploying this VM, I was safely able to explore common security flaws and experiment with penetration testing in a controlled setting.

Nessus, developed by Tenable, is a widely-used vulnerability scanner known for its comprehensive capabilities in identifying security weaknesses. By setting up Nessus on my Kali Linux machine, I was able to gain access to a robust toolset that can perform detailed scans and generate insightful reports on potential vulnerabilities.

This introduction outlines the steps for setting up a Metasploitable 2 machine and configuring Nessus on Kali Linux. It covers downloading and installing the necessary software, registering Nessus, and conducting vulnerability scans. 

## Objective

The primary objective of setting up a Metasploitable 2 machine and using Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities is to create a controlled environment for learning and testing cybersecurity concepts. This setup provides a safe platform to practice vulnerability scanning, identify security flaws, and understand how attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities. By registering Nessus and setting it up on Kali Linux, I was able to leverage a powerful toolset to simulate real-world scenarios, which eventually enhance my penetration testing skills, and improve my knowledge of network security.

### Steps to Achieve the Objective

By following the above steps, you should be able to effectively set up a Metasploitable 2 machine, configure Nessus on Kali Linux, and perform comprehensive vulnerability scans for the  improvement of cybersecurity skills.

### Overview
Unfortunately, this is a very vulnerable system as indicated from my Nessus vulnerability scan results shown in the images below. I got a total of 70 vulnerabilities from my scanning of this system. 11 of those are in Critical level with a CVSS base score of 10 which obviously need an immediate remediation, while 7 are high, 25 are medium level and 9 are low level. Fixing the vulnerabilities urgently is of paramount importance because failure to do so could lead to complete take over of the entire system by an attacker.


### Top 5 Most Serious Security Issues with their Remediations:

The critical security issue from the vulnerability scan of metasploitable 2 are as follows:

1. **NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure:**
It is discovered from the result of the scan that at least one of the NFS shares exported by the remote server could be mounted by the scanning host and this could enable an attacker to read and even write files on remote host. This is a very serious vulnerability and the severity level is Critical with CVSS v2.0 Base Score of 10*.
 
   **Remediations:**
NFS have to be configured on the remote host so that only authorized hosts can mount its remote shares.

2. **VNC Server 'password' Password:**
The password used for the VNC server running on the remote host is a very weak 	password and thats very dangarous. It was easy for Nessus to login using VNC authentication and a password of 'password'. A remote, unauthenticated hacker could 	take advantage of this to assume the total command and control of the system. This is 	also a very serious vulnerability and the severity level is Critical with CVSS v2.0 Base Score of 10*

   **Remediations:**
The solution for this is very simple, change your password and ensure you come up with a very strong password. Password with minimum length of 12, with special character, capital letter, small letters and no repetition of alphabet or number in a row.

3. **Unix Operating System Unsupported Version Detection:**
Having an unsupported operating system running on the remote host is a dangerous vulnerability. In this particular situation, the Unix operating system running on the 	remote host is now outdated and there is an urgent need for the latest version of it to be installed. Because its no longer supported, it means there wont be any new 	security patches release by the developer and as such giving an attacker avenue to exploit the system easily. This is also a very serious vulnerability and the severity level is Critical with CVSS v2.0 Base Score of 10.

   **Remediations:**
Upgrading to the latest version of the Unix operating system is the solution to this vulnerability.

4. **Debian OpenSSH/OpenSSL Package Random Number Generator Weakness:**
The remote x509 certificate on the remote SSL server has been generated on a Debian or Ubuntu system which contains a bug in the random number generator of its OpenSSL library.
The issue is due to a Debian packager eliminating almost all sources of entropy in the remote version of OpenSSL. Because of the above, it is easy for an attacker to 	obtain the private part of the remote key and then use it to decipher the remote session or even set up a man in the middle attack with it. This is also a very serious 	vulnerability and the 	severity level is Critical with CVSS v2.0 Base Score of 10.

   **Remediations:**
Every cryptographic material generated on the remote host should be considered to be guessable by anyone. Ensure you regenerate all SSL, SSH and OpenVPN key materials. 

5. **Bind Shell Backdoor Detection:**
A shell is tuning in on the remote port with next to no confirmation being required. An attacker may use it by connecting to the remote port and sending commands directly. This is also a serious vulnerability and the severity level is Critical with CVSS v2.0 Base Score of 10.

   **Remediations:**
Check if the remote host has been compromised, and if the answer is yes, then you should reinstall the system.
