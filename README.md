# Introduction
 
In the realm of cybersecurity, practical hands-on experience is crucial for understanding how to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Setting up a Metasploitable 2 machine in conjunction with Tenable Nessus provides an ideal environment for learning and honing these skills.

Metasploitable 2 is a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine designed for testing and development of security tools and techniques. By deploying this VM, I was safely able to explore common security flaws and experiment with penetration testing in a controlled setting.

Nessus, developed by Tenable, is a widely-used vulnerability scanner known for its comprehensive capabilities in identifying security weaknesses. By setting up Nessus on my Kali Linux machine, I was able to gain access to a robust toolset that can perform detailed scans and generate insightful reports on potential vulnerabilities.

This introduction outlines the steps for setting up a Metasploitable 2 machine and configuring Nessus on Kali Linux. It covers downloading and installing the necessary software, registering Nessus, and conducting vulnerability scans. 

## Objective

The primary objective of setting up a Metasploitable 2 machine and using Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities is to create a controlled environment for learning and testing cybersecurity concepts. This setup provides a safe platform to practice vulnerability scanning, identify security flaws, and understand how attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities. By registering Nessus and setting it up on Kali Linux, I was able to leverage a powerful toolset to simulate real-world scenarios, which eventually enhance my penetration testing skills, and improve my knowledge of network security.

### Steps to Achieve the Objective

#### 1. Setting Up the Metasploitable 2 Machine

1. **Download Metasploitable 2:**
   - Obtain the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine image from the official source (usually in a compressed file format).

2. **Extract and Import the VM:**
   - Extract the downloaded file.
   - Import the virtual machine into your preferred virtualization software (e.g. Mine is VirtualBox).

3. **Configure Network Settings:**
   - Set the network adapter to a suitable mode (NAT or Bridged) based on your network setup to allow communication between Metasploitable 2 and the Kali Linux machine.

4. **Start the VM:**
   - Power on the Metasploitable 2 VM and log in with the default credentials (e.g., username: `msfadmin`, password: `msfadmin`).

#### 2. Installing and Setting Up Nessus on Kali Linux

1. **Download Nessus:**
   - Navigate to the Tenable website and download the Nessus installer for Linux (specifically for Debian-based distributions like Kali Linux).

2. **Install Nessus:**
   - Open a terminal on Kali Linux.
   - Navigate to the directory where the Nessus installer was downloaded.
   - Run the command to install Nessus:
     ```bash
     sudo dpkg -i <Nessus-installer-package>.deb e.g mine is sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.7.3-ubuntu1404 amd64.deb
     ```

3. **Start Nessus Service:**
   - Start the Nessus service with the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start nessusd
     ```

4. **Access Nessus Web Interface:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8834` to access the Nessus web interface. e.g Mine is https://kali:8834/

5. **Register Nessus:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to create an account and register Nessus. You will need to obtain an activation code from the Tenable website.
   - Enter the activation code to complete the registration.

6. **Complete Setup and Install Plugins:**
   - Once registered, Nessus will download and install the necessary plugins. This process may take a few minutes.
   - After installation, log in to the Nessus web interface with your newly created account.

#### 3. Scanning the Metasploitable 2 Machine with Nessus

1. **Create a New Scan:**
   - In the Nessus web interface, navigate to the "Scans" section.
   - Click on "New Scan" and select a scan template (e.g., "Basic Network Scan").

2. **Configure the Scan:**
   - Provide a name for the scan.
   - Enter the IP address of the Metasploitable 2 machine.
   - Adjust any additional settings as needed.

3. **Launch the Scan:**
   - Click on the "Launch" button to start the vulnerability scan.

4. **Analyze the Results:**
   - Once the scan is complete, view the results to identify vulnerabilities on the Metasploitable 2 machine.
   - Analyze the report to understand the nature of the vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

### Benefits of This Setup

- **Hands-On Experience:** Provides practical experience with vulnerability scanning tools and techniques.
- **Safe Learning Environment:** Offers a controlled environment to test and understand vulnerabilities without risking real systems.
- **Skill Development:** Enhances skills in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
- **Understanding Attack Vectors:** Helps in understanding how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and the importance of securing systems.

By following these steps, users can effectively set up a Metasploitable 2 machine, configure Nessus on Kali Linux, and perform comprehensive vulnerability scans to improve their cybersecurity skills.

### Skills Learned

- Gain experience in identifying common vulnerabilities in systems and networks using Nessus scans.
- Develop the ability to analyze scan reports, understand the nature of detected vulnerabilities, and prioritize them based on severity.
- Learn about various techniques to mitigate vulnerabilities, such as patching, configuration changes, and network segmentation.
- Acquire basic penetration testing skills, including how to exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- Learn how to document the setup process, scan configurations, and findings effectively. This is crucial for reporting vulnerabilities and suggesting remediation steps.
- Learn how to download, install, and set up Nessus on a Linux system, including starting and managing the Nessus service.
- Understand the process of registering Nessus, including obtaining and entering activation codes, and configuring scan settings.
